Running the app:

After cloning the repo in your local system, open it in your code editor

In the terminal type "npm i -y"

The app will start working after you run "node index.js" in the terminal.
Once the application started it prompts the user for an action as the instruction appears in the terminal.

_This command-line application only works in the terminal_
